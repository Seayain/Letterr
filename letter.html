        <h1>My Love</h1>
        <p>
            It's been a year since the last Valentine, and my love for you has increased every day. Every day you provide me another reason to love you more.  
            I am struck in awe. How can someone as perfect as you exist? It's impossible; I can't make sense out of it; I literally can't.  
            It's beyond my comprehension. You are the most adorable, cutest, and most pookiest, yet you are also the person I trust when it comes to intellectual guidance in philosophical matters.  
            I had even told you before! That your grasp on philosophical topics is immense; it's unbelievable; it feels like God molded you into perfection with his own very hands.  
            You are perfection. You are perfect, my love.  
        </p>

        <p>
            I make a lot of mistakes. If I were to count the mistakes I made since last Valentine's, it would come in thousands,  
            but every single time you put me above my mistakes and forgave me.  
            Truly, Maryam, if it weren't for you, this relationship wouldn't last even for a second.  
            You are the person who is keeping it going, even though I gave you every reason to give up on me, yet you persist.  
            Thank you so much. Thank you, Maryam. I cannot tell you how it makes me feel; it makes me feel loved. Thank you, my love.  
        </p>

        <p>
            Talking with you every day, telling you what's in my heart and what went on in my day, and discussing everything with you.  
            I can proudly say that there isn't a single thing about me that you don't know.  
            You know everything about me—every single thing. It gives me a sense of specialness; I don't know why.  
            Being this close to someone, they know everything about you, yet they don't judge you or criticize you but choose to spend their entire day with you.  
            It's so heartwarming and makes me feel so special. Thank You, Meri Jaan.  
        </p>
